# Contours Viewer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benardp/contours_viewer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benardp/contours_viewer)

This viewer has been developed in support of the tutorial: *"Line Drawings from 3D Models"* by Pierre BÃ©nard and Aaron Hertzmann ([pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01175)).

Alternatively, Bastien Wailly and Adrien Bousseau developed and released the 3D line rendering software [SynDraw](https://ns.inria.fr/d3/syndraw/index.html) taking inspiration from our tutorial.

## Usage

A web version of this viewer is directly available following this link: https://benardp.github.io/contours_viewer/

The viewer can also be built and run on Linux, macOS and Windows.

## Compilation

The viewer is based on the geometry processing library [Geogram](http://alice.loria.fr/software/geogram) and thus uses its build system described on [this page](http://alice.loria.fr/software/geogram/doc/html/geogram_compiling.html).
